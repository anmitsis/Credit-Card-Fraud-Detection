# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
 This project detects fraudulent transactions using a Kaggle dataset. To address class imbalance, I applied downsampling and SMOTE oversampling techniques. I evaluated Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers on the original, downsampled, and oversampled datasets to improve fraud detection performance.
